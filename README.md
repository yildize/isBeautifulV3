## isBeautifulV1:
I was wondering, if a CNN image classifier is able to classify the "beauty". Of course beauty is a subjective concept, I've only tried to train a classifier which is able to detect the concept of "beautiful woman" based on google searches. I've created my dataset using google images search of "beatufiul/not beautiful women".

## isBeautifulV3:
This version uses two different models both trained by me. First one is the more advanced version of the previous image classifier with much more possible classes. The second model is an image regression model for age prediction.

So isBeatuifulV3 app basically tries to classify given image considering how beautiful/handsome the subject is and also predicts the age of the subject. Of course my intention is not to judge anyone, it is just a toy example project for me. 

Here is the binder link of the app:
